Note for Model Builders

You will require about 193 GB of disk space to build this module and the
archive, which is the default profile. The POM is set up to build the
the tree in the target directory, which will require about 131,867 MB
of disk space. It will then build a compressed archive, which will 
require an additional 65,249MB. 

Because of the large size of these artifacts, the POM is set up skip 
the install and deploy phases. You can manually perform these steps, or alter 
the POM to not skip if you want the archive to be copied to your local 
repository and/or your site repository.

You can control the creation of the archive and the location of the 
created tree through the use of a profile specification or the 
MODEL_DEST environment variable.

If the CreateTree profile is not specified and the MODEL_DEST environment
variable is not defined, the tree and an archive of that tree will be
built in the target directory, e.g.:

mvn install

If the MODEL_DEST environment variable is defined and identifies an existing
directory, the model tree will be built within that directory, and no archive
will be created.

MODEL_DEST=/nfs/shared_01/a2kd_external mvn install
